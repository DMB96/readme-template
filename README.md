![FARKLE]


A standard game of Farkle is played with a set of six, six-sided dice. With this project, students are going to create a digital version of the game. The official rules can be found at http://farkle.games/official-rules/

Java IDE

## Usage example

In Farkle, players take turns rolling dice and score points based on the combinations rolled. Players can choose to keep rolling to score more points or stop and bank their points. The first player to reach a set point total wins the game.To play the dice game Farkle, you typically need six dice, a pen, and paper. Players take turns rolling the dice, scoring points based on the combinations rolled. For instance, a single 1 is worth 100 points, a single 5 is worth 50 points, three of a kind is worth 100 times the number rolled (e.g., three 4s = 400 points), and so on. After each roll, the player sets aside scoring dice and can choose to roll the remaining non-scoring dice for more points. If a player rolls no scoring dice, they lose all points from that turn. The game continues until one player reaches a certain score threshold, typically 10,000 points.
